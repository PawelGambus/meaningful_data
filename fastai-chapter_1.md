Models are just programs. What makes them different is that a program executes a specific task. Model also does that but it can perform more than one task. It can be adjusted with weights to change what it's doing. It's a little bit like a parametrized program. Model is a more modern word to imply that it can actually do many different things.

Weights are referred to as model parameters. A weight is a subclass of a parameter.

A result of a model is something different than its performance. A result is simply an output. Performance is telling us how good that output is.
